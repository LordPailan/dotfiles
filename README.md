# My dotfiles

This little project serves as a quick shortcut in order to start a new development environment as fast as possible

Currently tested in MacOS X, CentOs, Debian and Ubuntu.

## Installation

Clone the repo to a separate directory, and then copy the files needed to your home directory.
They will be available after your next session, or inmediatly by typing

	$ source ~/.bash_profile # will include .bash_rc

## Usage

Just exec 
	$ start.sh 
and magic happens.

If you want to change default prompt to be less verbose and not show git state, change appropriate flag in .bashrc
