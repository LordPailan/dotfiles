# My dotfiles

This little project serves as a quick shortcut in order to start a new development environment as fast as possible

Currently tested in MacOS X, CentOs, Debian and Ubuntu.

## Usage

Just exec `$ start.sh` and magic happens.

If you want to change default prompt to be less verbose and not show git state, change appropriate flag in .bashrc
